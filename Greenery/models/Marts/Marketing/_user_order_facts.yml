models:
  - name: user_order_facts
    description: The 'user_order_facts' model is a summary of user order data. It
      includes the user_id, the total number of orders per user (order_count),
      binary flags indicating whether a user has placed an order (has_ordered)
      and whether a user has placed multiple orders (has_ordered_mult). It also
      includes the timestamp of the first and last order placed by each user
      (first_order_utc, last_order_utc), the average and total cost of orders
      (avg_order_costs, total_order_costs), the average and total shipping costs
      (avg_shipping_costs, total_shipping_costs), the average shipping time in
      days (avg_ship_time_days), and the count of distinct shipping services
      used (distinct_ship_svcs_count). The model is built by joining the
      'stg_orders' and 'stg_users' staging tables on the 'user_id' field.
    columns:
      - name: USER_ID
        description: The unique identifier for each user in the database. This is a

          otherwise, it will be 0. This is a NUMBER field.
      - name: HAS_ORDERED_MULT
        description: This is a binary flag that indicates whether a user has placed more
          than one order. A value of 1 means the user has placed multiple
          orders, while a value of 0 means the user has placed one or no orders.
      - name: FIRST_ORDER_UTC
        description: This timestamp indicates the date and time of the user's first
          order in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). If the user has not placed
          any orders, this field will be null.
      - name: LAST_ORDER_UTC
        description: This timestamp indicates the date and time of the user's most
          recent order in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). If the user has not
          placed any orders, this field will be null.
      - name: AVG_ORDER_COSTS
        description: This column represents the average cost of all orders placed by a
          user. It is calculated by taking the sum of all order costs and
          dividing it by the total number of orders. If a user has not placed
          any orders, the value will be 0.
      - name: TOTAL_ORDER_COSTS
        description: This column represents the total cost of all orders placed by a
          user. It is calculated by summing up the cost of all orders. If a user
          has not placed any orders, the value will be 0.
      - name: AVG_SHIPPING_COSTS
        description: This column represents the average shipping cost for all orders
          placed by a user. It is calculated by taking the sum of all shipping
          costs and dividing it by the total number of orders. If a user has not

      - name: TOTAL_SHIPPING_COSTS
        description: This column represents the total shipping costs for all orders made
          by a user. It is calculated by summing up the shipping costs of all

          orders are found for the user.
      - name: AVG_SHIP_TIME_DAYS
        description: This column represents the average shipping time in days for all
          orders made by a user. It is calculated by taking the average of the
          difference in days between the order creation date and the delivery
          date for all orders associated with a particular user.
      - name: DISTINCT_SHIP_SVCS_COUNT
        description: This column represents the count of distinct shipping services used
          by a user for all their orders. It is calculated by counting the
